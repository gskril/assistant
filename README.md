# AI Voice Assistant

## [Frontend](web/)

A simple web app built with Next.js, Tailwind, and the OpenAI SDK. It has a single button for audio recording, which it then transcribes and processes with OpenAI's tools. Finally, the response is converted into speech, sent back to the frontend in base64 format, and played.
